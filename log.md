# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 1: 

**To Do**
- Create the skeleton for a bible progress app

**Today's Progress:**
- Made a half completed working bible progress website. 
- Implemented chapter searching and marking using cookies and class toggles.

**Thoughts:** \
Initially tried to use mongoose and several back end stuff, but eventually found out that I don't even need to use back end, working with front end is good enough.
Learnt cookies, some jQuery and a lot of JS objects.

## Day 2: 

**Today's Progress:**
- Made a progress bar for the bible progress website.
- Made function to select a whole chapter.
- Realized that I am dumb D:

**Thoughts:** \
Didn't knew that cookies have a size limit on browsers, spent hours literally finding the bug. I'll gotta fix it tomorrow, maybe using another format for my cookies!

## Day 3: 

**Today's Progress:**
- Reformatted the whole cookie thing
- Fixed too many bugs for the list view
- Added scrollbars so list view looks better

**Thoughts:** \
Ah I am finally finished with this project, I can rest peacefully now... Next time I should probably plan the whole project out properly before doing it to prevent situations like this happening :D
